    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><strong>What is Risotto Carbonara?</strong></p>
    <p>Let’s break it down:</p>
    <p>Risotto is a northern Italian rice dish cooked with broth until it reaches a creamy consistency.</p>
    <p>Carbonara is traditionally a pasta dish made with egg yolks, hard cheese (such as Parmesan and/or Romano), cured pork, and freshly cracked black pepper.</p>
    <p>Our Risotto Carbonara is a delicious marriage of the two – combining the same smoky flavors of a carbonara in creamy risotto instead of pasta.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>4 ounces bacon, diced</li>
            <li>4 ounces sliced Genoa salami, diced</li>
            <li>3 cups chicken stock, homemade if possible</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>1 cup onions, diced</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon garlic, minced</li>
            <li>Pinch red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>1 cup Arborio rice</li>
            <li>¼ cup white wine</li>
            <li>2 egg yolks</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons heavy cream</li>
            <li>½ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>½ cup freshly grated Romano cheese</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons Italian flat leaf parsley, chopped</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon white pepper</li>
            <li>Salt as needed (depending on how salty your stock is)</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Before you begin, have all ingredients measured out. Risotto needs attention once you start cooking it.</li>
            <li>In a medium heavy bottomed pan or Dutch oven, over medium heat, add the olive oil and once hot, add the bacon.</li>
            <li>Cook the bacon five minutes until almost crisp. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside.</li>
            <li>Add the salami and cook only 1-2 minutes to slightly crisp, being careful not to burn. Remove with a slotted spoon and add to the bacon.</li>
            <li>Pour the fat into a bowl and wipe the inside of the hot pan with a wad of paper towels to pick up and dark pieces or sediment.</li>
            <li>Heat the stock in a separate small sauce pan and keep hot.</li>
            <li>Return the Dutch oven to medium heat and measure in two tablespoons of the bacon fat along with the butter.</li>
            <li>Once the butter has melted, add the onions and cook three minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the garlic and red pepper flakes and cook one minute then add the rice and cook for two minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the wine and once the wine evaporates, reduce the heat to medium low and start adding hot chicken stock one half cup at a time, making sure that each addition gets absorbed in before adding more.</li>
            <li>After about 15-20 minutes, all of the stock should be in and absorbed. Cover the pot and remove from heat and let sit five minutes.</li>
            <li>While the rice sits, in a medium bowl, beat the egg yolks and heavy cream.</li>
            <li>After the rice sat for five minutes, scoop out spoonfuls of the rice and whisk into the cream and egg mixture to temper the eggs. After adding a cup or so, stir this mixture back into the rice pot.</li>
            <li>Off heat add in the reserved cooked bacon and salami, the Parmesan and Romano cheese, the chopped Italian parsley and the white pepper.</li>
            <li>Taste and add only enough salt to season the rice. The bacon and salami are salty and your stock may be salty, so you may not need any additional salt.</li>
            <li>Stir and serve and if it gets too thick, loosen with additional stock or water.</li>
        </ol>
